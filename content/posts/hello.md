Hi there. This is my new blog. I'm trying out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and
rather produce something real, which causes me _real_ problems to solve. On this
blog, I'd like to document the progress of various things I'm learning this
year.

The goal is to publish useful information rather than keeping a journal for
self-castigation when I'm not doing anything useful.

# Topics

So here's what my readers can expect (German speaking readers can also refer to
my [2024 Ideas](https://paedubucher.ch/articles/2024-01-01-ideen-fuer-2024.html)
post on my main website):

- Programming Languages
    - Erlang
    - Rust
    - Haskell
    - TypeScript
    - Shell Scripting
- Technologies
    - Ansible
    - Hugo
- Literature
    - Software and Mind

# Progress

Here's what I already did:

- **Erlang**: Working through Joe Armstrong's [Programming Erlang (2nd
  Edition)](https://pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang2/programming-erlang-2nd-edition/),
  I read the first parts including _Concurrent and Distributed Programs_.
  However, I lost my interest right before _Programming Libraries and
  Frameworks_. In this part, I'd like to dive into ETS/DETS and Mnesia. The
  other parts I can still read if I actually run into problems related to those
  topics. However, the two OTP chapters can be a good introduction before using
  Elixir again. So I got everything out of Erlang already and most likely will
  continue to work with Elixir. I was able two write a compression/decompression
  program in Erlang based on Huffman coding trees. This would make for a good
  blog article, I guess.
- **Rust**: I peeked into [Learn Rust in a Month of
  Lunches](https://www.manning.com/books/learn-rust-in-a-month-of-lunches)
  today, but I consider it too basic for my purposes. (I don't need an
  introduction into the various integer sizes and the like.) So I started with
  the enhanced version of the [Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/)
  provided by Brown University.
- **Haskell**: I started working through [Effective
  Haskell](https://pragprog.com/titles/rshaskell/effective-haskell/). The book
  is rather verbose, which makes me just skimming some parts. However, I managed
  to setup my first Cabal project with working Unit Tests. There's a lot to
  read, but I'm making steady progress. (I'd like to write a blog post on
  setting up such a sample project.)
- **TypeScript**: I started working through [Essential TypeScritp 5 (3rd
  Edition)](https://www.manning.com/books/essential-typescript-5-third-edition),
  which offers a much better reading experience than O'Reilly's [Programming
  TypeScript](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-typescript/9781492037644/).
  I'm going to stick to that book.
- **Shell Scripting**: I got [Learning the Korn
  Shell](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-the-korn/1565920546/) out
  of my shelf again; that's it for progress on this front…
- **Ansible**: I worked through the Ansible chapters in [DevOps for the
  Desperate](https://nostarch.com/devops-desperate) and prepared some exercises
  for a class. I continued with O'Reilly's [Ansible Up &
  Running](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ansible-up-and/9781098109141/),
  which looks like a rather decent book. I'm going to setup my company's
  infrastructure using a local Vagrant environment following this book.
- **Hugo**: Well, this page was created using Hugo. I'm working through [Hugo in
  Action](https://www.manning.com/books/hugo-in-action), which is rather
  verbose. On the first 30 pages, the author mainly talked about how amazing
  Hugo is. I'd rather get to know how all the parts work together. So I just
  have to be patient and work on something real besides, hence this blog, which
  I build up based on the [blank theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/blank/).
  So this blog well be evolving in the next days and weeks…
- **Software and Mind**: I finally got the used print copy (in great condition)
  of [Software and Mind](http://softwareandmind.com/) and so far only read the
  introduction of roughly 40 pages. Now comes the interesting part on the
  _Mechanistic Myth_. I wanted to read Popper's _Logic of Scientific Discovery_
  first, but am now under the impression that Andrei Sorin provides enough
  theory about the Demarcation Problem and epistemology in general.

So I'm working on all fronts—on _too_ many fronts?—at the moment and make
progress everywhere. I also plan to write about what I learn, which is the
purpose of this blog.

So stay tuned!
